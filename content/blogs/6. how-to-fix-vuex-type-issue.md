### Introduction

In recent version of our vue project, when we try to add vuex we see type error and vuex type not found. We can easily fix that issue.

### How to fix that issue

1. Create a `vuex.d.ts` file inside of your route project.
2. Pase this code in that file
```ts
declare module "vuex" {
  export * from "vuex/types/index.d.ts";
  export * from "vuex/types/helpers.d.ts";
  export * from "vuex/types/logger.d.ts";
  export * from "vuex/types/vue.d.ts";
}

```
3. That's it. Your are ok to go.
